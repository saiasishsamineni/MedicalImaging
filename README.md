Here is the Link for the GUI: https://detect.roboflow.com/?model=ultrasoundbabyproject&version=3&api_key=N2GBxqH6yLH28EowHWIS

To use, follow the link to access the online GUI. Proceed to type ‘baby’ in the class name filter, and adjust confidence/overlap accordingly (set it low, as the model is not perfect). Pick any image, preferably one with a baby in ultrasound, and upload. With run inference, you’ll be able to see if it is detected.


To train and run the model yourself, run the notebook attached. You might receive a prompt to “restart the runtime” to fully update the libraries and train the model. Once finished, you can return to the GUI and try to do image detection!
